# conveyor-chaos
A small game made in rust with [GGEZ](https://ggez.rs/).

In Conveyor Chaos, use a set of suprisingly versitile conveyor belts to merge, split and manipulate objects to your will. Heavily inspired by Zachtronics games such as Opus Magnum and Molek Syntez.

## Roadmap
- [X] Barebones Solution Editor
- [ ] Fully functional solution simulator
- [ ] Tutorial (probably just in a markdown file)
- [ ] All the tiles/tools
- [ ] Win and Error States
- [ ] Multiple Levels
- [ ] A menu and stuff
- [X] Better Textures
- [ ] In game tutorial
- [ ] Whatever else I want if I'm still working on this project

## Known bugs
 - Rotating a held tile will also rotate the tile you are hovering over.
 - Not placing any outputs results in the player instantly winning
